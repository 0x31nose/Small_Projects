        "I developed this calculator to help you plan pay back your loans. I assume that a lot of people struggle with planning paying back your loans. I personally found it difficult to calculate by hand, so I decided to write this program in Python so that I can create a payment plan. I hope this would help you in any ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Variables\n",
        "- interest_rate: the interest rate of your loan. (e.g. if the interest rate is 6%, the number you type in 0.06.)\n",
        "- loaned_amount: the total amount of your loan. (e.g. if the total amount of your loan is $50,000, you type in 50000.)\n",
        "- loaned_period: the length of your payment. (e.g. if you plan to pay back your loan in 6 years, you type in 72. (6 years = 12 * 6))\n",
        "- monthly_payment: the amount of your monthly payment (e.g. if you plan to pay 1000 usd per month, you type in 500.)\n",
        "- bonus: the amount of your bonus (e.g. if your bonus is 8000 usd you type in 8000)\n",
        "- unit: the unit of your currency. The default is set to USD.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Bonus\n",
        "- This program assumes that you receive two bonuses every year. I created if-sentence in for-loop. Modify that number if you receive more/less bonus."
